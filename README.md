# 🌟 Phoebe Woofter's Portfolio

A personal portfolio built with **React + Vite**, showcasing both **copywriting** and **software development** projects.

## 📖 Overview
This portfolio highlights my dual career path:
- **Copywriting**: Professional work across email marketing, landing pages, campaigns, blogs, style guides, brochures, and social media.
- **Software Development**: Front‑end projects that explore interactivity, gamification, and user‑centered design.

## 👩‍💻 About Me
I’m a Portland‑based **copywriter** with five years of professional experience and a **B.A. in English** from the University of San Diego.  

My work spans industries from architecture and wellness to publishing and retail. Whether it’s a punchy headline, a long‑form article, or a conversion‑driven email sequence, I focus on creating copy that connects authentically while driving measurable results.

Alongside my copywriting career, I’m building a foundation in **software development**. On my GitHub, you’ll find projects that reflect my curiosity for front‑end development and gamification — from HTML/CSS practice to interactive tools that make complex topics more engaging.  

I’m currently:
- Learning **TypeScript**
- Sharpening skills in **user‑centered design**
- Exploring how **code + copy** can create intuitive, conversion‑friendly digital experiences

Outside of work, I enjoy running marathons, skate skiing, gaming, traveling with my partner, and hanging out with my three cats — Suh, Honeycomb, and Pancho 🐾.
